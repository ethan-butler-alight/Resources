# Resources

## About
Here is a list of cool resources that I have collected and will add to over time. Originally, I just had many bookmarks with folders but figured it would be better here on Github where I can access it easier and others can also. It has things from development, security, math, design, philosophy, and other stuff I find interesting. There are tools, videos, articles, github repos, and other types of links.
